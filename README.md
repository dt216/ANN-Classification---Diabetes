# ANN-Classification---Diabetes
Build a neural net to predict whether patients have diabetes based on certain data. The data had a lot of issues so required cleaning. For example:

* There were patients with a BMI of < 10 which is very low and highly unlikely for any human
* There were patients who had an age of 5 but said to have had 3 children. This is also not possible

After cleaning the data we built the NN to get an accuracy of around 75%
